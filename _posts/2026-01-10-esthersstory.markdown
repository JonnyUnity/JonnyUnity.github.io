paragraph1: <p>My first game jam working in a team of six where I was the sole programmer. The jam had the theme of Big and took place over two weeks in a more relaxed setting so I did an hour or two each evening during the jam. The team very quickly arrived at the idea of playing with scale and a story of a girl trapped in a dollhouse.</p><br/><p>I was the one to offer the idea of selecting two objects, one highlighted in red, the other blue, like Portal and have the objects swap their size. I put together a concept quickly using a bounce easing function on the object scales which won the team over and they began to work on puzzles and theming in the game.</p>​<br/><p>The jam was set up to make teams after listing your area of expertise so it was a new challenge to work with people I've never met before but it was great working with people from other disciplines and we managed to make something that feels cohesive.</p>

paragraph2: <p>Most notable about Esther's Story is that the narrator's lines are fully voice-acted and it includes a cut-scene video for the game's ending. I had not done any programming with cut-scenes before but with the Video component it was straightforward enough and the art, animation and music folks did a great job!</p>
