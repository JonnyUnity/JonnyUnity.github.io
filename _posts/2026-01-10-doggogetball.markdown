paragraph1: <p>This was my submission for Zeno Jam 4. A short 2 day jam with the theme "I Am Everywhere"</p><br/><p>I almost immediately knew I wanted to make a "snake" type game but with the condition that the board has to be completely filled before reaching the exit, which is the doggo's ball. I originally had a concept of a world eating snake borrowed from mythology but opted for a lighter tone with the doggo that's just trying to reach its ball.</p><br/><p>A count of the number of unoccupied spaces is kept and a level is deemed complete when this count is zero when reaching the exit. This does mean that there is no one set solution for each level. So as long as the player has filled the board when reaching the exit it will be treated as a success.</p><br/><p>I sourced the art and sound assets but couldn't find a fitting dog sprite and with the short time constraints I opted to create my own - I'm by no means an artist but the character was popular amongst the jam community. Results and comments can be found here.</p>
