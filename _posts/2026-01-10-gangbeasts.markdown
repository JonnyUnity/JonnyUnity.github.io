paragraph1: <p>I joined the Gang Beasts team when I first started Coatsink. It was a small team where my lead was working on the next-gen port whilst I was handling bugs and other issues.</p><p>We had weekly meetings with Boneloaf and managed my tasks using Clickup. Whilst bug-fixing I liased with qa for more information on certain issues and attended their internal playtest sessions.</p><p>I did get an opportunity to prototype a new game mode, similar to the football mode but with an always moving ball and barriers akin to Blockout. It was fun to get the chance to add something in to an established game and do some design work which I also enjoy.</p>

paragraph2: <p>It was a great experience where I got to work on a wide number of systems in the project.</p><p>These include, but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Lobby/matchmaking issues - joining/merging/syncing costumes</li><li>Costume issues</li><li>User language settings</li><li>Object sync issues during online games</li><li>AI behaviour issues (incorrect target for AI beasts in waves mode)/tentacles and shark pathing on aquarium</li><li>Switch controller issues - adding extra players in lobby</li><li>Level-specific issues - lightbaking, fixing water physics, stability</li><li>Input issues - keyboard vs controller</li><li>Camera issues</li><li>Menu/UI issues - settings not saved/loaded properly, navigation issues</li><li>Wrote unlit shader for confetti lighting issue</li><li>New language character issues</li><li>Created dev PC/Switch/PS4 builds for internal testing.</li></ul>
