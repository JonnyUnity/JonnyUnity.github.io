paragraph1: <p>My submission to the Game Dev London x Into Games Global Game Jam 2022. The game jam lasted 48 hours and the theme was "Duality". I designed, programmed and sourced assets entirely on my own.</p><br/><p>Inspired by Enter the Gungeon and Captain America I chose to create a simple top-down game where a soldier finds a shield that can be held in defence or thrown at their enemies.</p><p>Despite the short length of the jam I added an in-game tutorial to teach the player the controls.</p><p><a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-dev-london-x-into-games-ggj22/rate/1376504" target="_blank">Results and feedback can be found here</a>.</p>
