paragraph1: <p>For this jam I teamed up with my artist friend from earlier jam submission Office Secrets to enter the Zeno Jam 5, a jam that lasted three days with the theme "Light Attracts Bugs". We decided to make a cute puzzle game where levels are solved by turning on and off lights that encourage Scrawny, the protagonist, to reach the goal. </p>​<br/><p>In this jam, I opted to do some up-front architecture setup and laid the groundwork with a bootstrap scene that would contain the common manager prefabs and scripts so each level scene could be easily tested from the Editor and wouldn't require starting from the normal entry-point of the game.</p>​<br/><p>We opted to take a relaxed pace and whilst the game was complete and well presented, it ended up with only a small number of puzzles. We perhaps could have added more but we decided to go with what was feature complete rather than add something that could have ended up half-finished by the time the jam was over.</p>

paragraph2: <p>The main feedback from our peers was that our game was great but lacking in content but even despite this it was voted 4th overall in the jam which we were of course pretty pleased with.</p><br/><p>I believe that with a jam this short the main focus is to prove a mechanic works and to satisfy the theme, not necessarily produce a full game ready to be published and I strongly feel we achieved that.</p>
