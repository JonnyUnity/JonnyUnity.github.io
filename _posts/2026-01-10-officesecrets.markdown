paragraph1: <p>I took part in Narrative Imperative Game Jam \#1 in a team of four. The jam lasted for two weeks and the theme was "This is bigger than you".</p><p>I was the only developer in the team and also acted as project manager/producer arranging catch-up calls and handling assets from art, narrative and audio.</p>

paragraph2: <p>We knew we wanted to make a game involving some kind of conspiracy and with narrative being the focus of the jam I was keen for your choices to matter, ideally utilising the "person will remember this" concept from Telltale games. Whilst we didn't end up doing that I did program a dialogue system that would branch based on previous responses made.</p>

paragraph3: <p>We ended up having three distinct endings which we mapped out using Miro which allowed us to collaborate and quickly throw ideas and flows together.</p>​<br/><p>The jam was a little different in that rather the submissions be scored by the other entrants of the jam, this one had a panel of judges and cash prizes for the top 3.</p><p>Whilst that wasn't the main reason for participating, we came 2nd in the scoring and won a small prize as a bonus!</p>
